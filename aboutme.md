Hi There! 
I'm Isadora and I'm currently living in Christchurch. 
I love technology and at the moment I'm working as an IT administrator. Also, I'm learning how to code, in my GitHub you will see a few of my projects.
I'm a fast learner and a dedicated person. I won't give up until I learn how to solve my problems. 

:)
